1) This dataset contains 1,000 clean images. Each clean image was used to generate 14 rainy images with different streak orientations and magnitudes.


2) 900 images are randomly selected for "training" and the rest images are used for "testing". 


3) We use PhotoShop to generate rainy images: http://www.photoshopessentials.com/photo-effects/rain/
